# Working notes

## Content system (2026-08-18 restructure)

Sections: Hardware (`data/hardware/`), Software (`data/software/`), Articles (`data/blog/`).
One folder per item, `NN_slug/index.md`; NN is display order and clusters the `group`
frontmatter values, which the tab pages render as section headings in first-appearance
order. Frontmatter beyond the original schema: `status`, `provenance` (core|community),
`platform` (hardware slug, on software items), `arch` (hardware items), `repo`.
Old routes /work, /projects, /talks, /writing redirect. Card media falls back to
`/lab-media/<kind>/<slug>.webp` (none exist yet; cards render typographic until real
captures are added, `cover:` in frontmatter also works).

Every fact on the site was verified against the repos/articles/press on 2026-08-18.
Notes-vs-source corrections applied: snesrecomp is alpha (not late beta); ndsrecomp is
pre-alpha but Metroid Prime Hunters is public alpha (not pre-alpha); gcnrecompiled was
renamed gcnlle and builds on DolRecomp (ModernGekko not referenced); ALttP widescreen
caps at 446px (~2:1), not 21:9; no 21:9 claim verified for Buu's Fury or Mario Kart
Super Circuit; Pokemon host-clock RTC sync not documented; Mega Man X "no slowdown" not
documented; NES Mesen HD texture pack support not documented; mstan/xboxlle does not
exist publicly (only xboxlle-probe).

## Content follow-ups (missing sources)

- Twisted Metal 4 recomp repo URL (covered by retro-gamer.jp; page links coverage only).
- Pepsiman browser recomp repo URL (Notebookcheck coverage only).
- Sonic 2 Android community port: no URL.
- Cobalt's projects (Klonoa, TM4 relation, SFA3), ActRaiser, Metal Warriors (netplay +
  16:9 plans), Legend of Legaia: no public URLs found; not published.
- Tweets mentioned in team notes: no URLs supplied; none published.
- Time Extension article: exact publication day not shown on page (August 2026).
- PC Gamer and GamesRadar Spyro pieces exist but bylines/dates unverified; not cited.
  PC Gamer's "no AI" framing vs Time Extension's "AI-assisted" framing is worth a
  deliberate editorial decision before citing either.
- Withheld as non-public by request: Mario Kart DS, SM64DS, Pokemon Black (NDS),
  Rocket Knight Adventures (Genesis). Super Metroid repo is public but early; mentioned
  on the SNES page without its own page.
- No screenshots/video captures exist in-repo; all pages are text-only until the team
  supplies media (drop into item folders and reference via `cover:`/`gallery:`).
